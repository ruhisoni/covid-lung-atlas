# A molecular single-cell lung atlas of lethal COVID-19: A Reproduction Project

This project seeks to reproduce some of the results obtained by [Melms et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03569-1). The original study's authors performed scRNAseq on the lungs of 7 healthy controls and 19 individuals who died of COVID-19. They identified significant differences in transcriptional cell states between the two groups.

This repository is under development.
